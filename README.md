# React Router
** NOTES **

In this demo application I create an application to post and view popular quotes with React Router V5. I leave detailed notes about how the router is working and how to implement different react tools such as effects or hooks with React Router.
I also left notes at the top of the following files to breakdown all of the changes that were made in React Router V6 that would need to be changed in this application to upgrade.

* App.js
* MainNavigation
* AddQuote
* QuoteDetail
* QuoteForm
